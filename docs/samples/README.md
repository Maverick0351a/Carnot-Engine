# Public Samples

This directory is published via Cloudflare Pages to showcase example outputs.

Assets:
- `attestation.md` – Example attestation document produced by the API / CLI.
- `pcap-proof.png` – Placeholder network capture visualization (replace with real anonymized capture showing hybrid TLS negotiation).

Update workflow:
1. Generate a fresh attestation with real observations.
2. Redact sensitive identifiers (hosts, IPs) if needed.
3. Commit updated artifacts; Pages redeploys automatically.

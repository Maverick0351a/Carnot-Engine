# Task 09 — One‑pager: Discovery‑Only Assessment

**Goal:** Create a crisp, buyer‑ready one‑pager with scope, deliverables, timeline, and price.

## Prompt
Copilot, create `docs/ASSESSMENT_TEMPLATE.md` with sections:
- **What you get (2 weeks)**: CryptoBOM v2.1 (static+runtime+AWS), Top‑N plan, policy results, PQC proof, signed attestation.
- **Scope**: one repo + one VPC/staging cluster; endpoint telemetry in staging where permitted.
- **Method**: handshake‑only telemetry, no payloads, privacy controls, on‑prem optional.
- **Timeline**: Day 1 kickoff → Day 10 delivery → Day 12 exec readout.
- **Price**: $5k–$25k (pick tier).
- **Acceptance**: list of artifacts delivered.
- **Data Handling**: list what we capture vs never capture (short DPA snippet).

Also add `docs/EMAIL_OUTREACH.md` with 3 email variants for healthcare/fintech/gov vendor.

## Acceptance
- Files check in and read cleanly.

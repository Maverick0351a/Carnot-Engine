# COPILOT â€” Operator Guide

This folder contains **copy/paste prompts** and step-by-step tasks for GitHub Copilot Chat inside VS Code.
**After every task, append an entry to `WORKLOG.md`** and commit.

Quick start:
1. Open VS Code in this repo (Dev Container or Codespaces).
2. Open a task markdown and paste the **Prompt** into Copilot Chat.
3. When Copilot proposes changes, accept & run the listed commands.
4. Append to `WORKLOG.md`, commit, and open a PR.

**Golden rule:** Every task must be reproducible. Always include exact commands and outputs.
